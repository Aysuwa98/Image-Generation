Project: Image Generation

Overview

This project involves manipulating images using Python's Pillow library. The main functionality is to take an image (referred to as "broken_600.png"), crop it into different sections, resize, rotate, and then assemble these sections into a final image with a "frame" effect. The code also includes a feature that draws an image of an island, which serves as part of the picture.

Key Features

Image Cropping: The script crops sections of an image into smaller pieces and applies transformations.
Resizing & Rotating: Cropped sections are resized and rotated to create a more dynamic layout.
Image Assembly: The transformed sections are pasted back into the original image to create a final frame.
Island Drawing: A simple island image is drawn using basic shapes like ellipses, rectangles, polygons, and lines.
Requirements

Python 3.x
Pillow library
You can install the Pillow library using pip if you don't have it installed already:

pip install Pillow
How to Use

Place your image named broken_600.png in the same directory as the script.
Run the script. The script will:
Draw an island image.
Process the "broken_600.png" image by cropping and transforming sections.
Save the final image as final_project.png.
Display the final image.
Example Output:
The final image will have four colored sections (blue, green, red, yellow) arranged in a frame-like design, with an island drawn in the center.

Code Explanation

draw_picture()
This function creates an image of an island. It uses basic shapes and text to draw an island scene with a blue sea, green land, and a yellow line (which can represent a shore or river).

fix_fram(file_name)
This function loads the "broken_600.png" image, crops it into four sections (blue, green, red, and yellow), resizes and rotates them, and then pastes them back into the image to form a frame-like design.

frame_picture()
This is the main function that calls draw_picture() to create the island and then processes the "broken_600.png" image by calling fix_fram(). It saves and displays the final image as final_project.png.
